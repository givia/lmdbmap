# LMDB is usually found via find_library/find_path in the main project, 
# but for the config we might need to ensure it's found if we are linking against it.
# Since lmdbmap is INTERFACE and links against ${LMDB_LIBRARY}, consumers need to find it.
# However, standard FindLMDB.cmake is not always available. 
# We can try to find it again or assume the consumer finds it.
# Better to provide a hint or find it.

# For simplicity, let's assume the system has it or the user provides it.
# But since we used find_library in the main CMakeLists, we should probably try to find it here too 
# if we want to be helpful, OR rely on the fact that it's an interface link library.

# Actually, since we linked with absolute path in the build, we need to be careful.
# Ideally we should create an IMPORTED target for LMDB if we want to export it properly, 
# or just let the user link it.

# Let's try to find it again to be safe.
